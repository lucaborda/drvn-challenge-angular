# Drvn Challenge

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.6.
Also was developed using as package manager [Bun](https://bun.sh/). I choose bun because i hear its really powerful

## Development installation

I recommend to use bun for the pm.
Once you cloned the repo you should run the following command.

_Recommended_

```bash
bun install
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve --port 4200 --host 127.0.0.1
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) using [Bun](https://bun.sh/), use the following command:

```bash
bun jest
```

## Running end-to-end and functional tests

**End-To-End and Functional test were developed with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)**
For the execution of the end-to-end (e2e) and functional tests, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```
